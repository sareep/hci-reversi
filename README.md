# hci-reversi

This repository is a web app that I built in Fall 2019 for my Human-Computer Interaction course at Westmont College, taught by Dr. Don Patterson. The app is for users to play the game of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). It runs a Node.js server which uses Socket.io to manage users and games. To see the app in action, go [here](https://reversi-sareep.herokuapp.com/index.html)!

The scope of the course was to teach web-development skills and technologies, with the opportunity to explore and learn on our own. After the course, and for my senior project, I decided to add AI to my app in the form of bots to play against! I am in the final stages of implementing a Reinforcement Learning bot using the library [BURLAP](http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/), as well as a Minimax bot I am building myself. 

Feedback is welcomed! 

This project was intended to teach me and expose me to a variety of technologies, including: 
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS
  * Bootstrap
* Socket.io
* Node.js
* Heroku
